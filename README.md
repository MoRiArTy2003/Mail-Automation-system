# Mail Automation System

This project offers a collection of Python scripts designed to automate email sending tasks. It streamlines processes such as sending emails with attachments, compressing files, and modifying files before sending.

## Features

- **Automated Email Sending**: Leverages Pythonâ€™s `smtplib` for sending emails automatically.
- **File Compression**: Compress files into ZIP format before sending.
- **Attachment Handling**: Easily attach files to emails.
- **File Modification**: Modify or reformat files prior to compression and sending.

## Repository Contents

- **demomail.py**: The main script for sending emails with attachments.
- **mail_zip.py**: A script to compress files into a ZIP archive and send them via email.
- **pyzip_change.py**: A script to modify files before compressing and sending.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- An email account (e.g., Gmail) with valid credentials.
- Required Python libraries (e.g., `smtplib`, `zipfile`). If additional packages are needed, consider including them in a `requirements.txt`.
